<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java embedded, transactional data
store. It supplies a key/object data model with indexing, full transactional
ACID support, POJO APIs and High Availability/Replication.
<p>
Note that in JE 6.0 and later, the Java compatibility requirement for JE is
Java SE 7 and the open source license is the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
<p>
JE is compatible with Java SE 7 and later, and has been tested and certified
against Oracle JDK 7u67 and IBM J9 7.0. We encourage you to upgrade to the
latest Java releases to take advantage of the latest bug fixes and performance
improvements.
<p>
In JE 6.2 the on-disk file format moved to 10.  The file format change is
forward compatible in that JE files created with release 6.1 and earlier can be
read when opened with JE 6.2 or later. The change is not backward compatible in
that files created with JE 6.2 or later cannot be read by earlier releases.
After an existing environment is opened read/write using JE 6.2, the
environment can no longer be read by earlier releases.
<p>
Be sure to see the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for more information
